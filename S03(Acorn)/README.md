Season 3 episodes are mostly "progressive", the second field is just a fake interpolated image of the first field. One way to deal with this is to throw away the second field and properly upscale it, then you won't see stairsteps on the edges. There are a few 59.94i scenes, where small features like stars are on alternating fields, so single field deinterlacers would be losing a lot of detail there. And also the usual hybrid scenes, 4 + 1 dup and 5 real frames layered on top of each other. These are harder to fix, no redundant fields to choose from.
